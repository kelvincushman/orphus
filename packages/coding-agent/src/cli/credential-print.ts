 * - `--model` is required, so no ambient "current model" can emit a credential
 *   the caller did not name;
 * - there is no `--output <file>` and no clipboard path — stdout only;
 * - every failure is a distinct exit code, and stdout stays empty on all of
 *   them but one — `CredentialTruncated` (exit 9) exists to report the case
 *   where it cannot be, because bytes already left and cannot be recalled;
 * - a failed OAuth refresh never mutates the stored credential.
 *
 * One residual, and it is upstream: when a model infers several eligible
 * providers, each is asked for its credential before the ambiguity is known, so
 * a *successful* refresh can rotate and persist a credential this command then
 * declines to emit (exit 3). See the note on the `getAuth()` call in the

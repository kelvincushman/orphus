/**
 * Stand-in model endpoint for the issue #2074 end-to-end scenario.
 *
 * `test/integration/workflow-stage-steering-queue-cli.test.ts` needs a workflow stage that is
 * genuinely mid-turn while the user types into its stage chat, detaches, and
 * reattaches. The queue only holds a message while the stage session is
 * streaming, so the turn has to still be open at every step of the scenario.
 *
 * This server answers any request with an `openai-responses` SSE stream that
 * opens a turn, says one line, and then never completes: it keeps the response
 * alive with a heartbeat delta so the transport cannot time it out. Nothing in
 * the scenario waits for the turn to end, and the CLI is killed at the end, so
 * a stream with no terminator is the whole point rather than a leak.
 *
 * It is a separate process on purpose, so the CLI under test talks to the same
 * endpoint shape as a real session rather than a model mocked in-process.
 *
 * Usage: bun issue-2074-model-server.ts <state-dir>
 * Writes `<state-dir>/model-port` once listening; that file is the readiness
 * signal, so a driver never has to guess a port or sleep for startup.

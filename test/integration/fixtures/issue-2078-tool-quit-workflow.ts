/**
 * Project workflow fixture for the issue #2078 end-to-end scenario.
 *
 * `test/integration/workflow-tool-node-quit-cli.test.ts` copies this file into
 * a scratch project's `.atomic/workflows/` and lets the real Atomic CLI discover it, so it
 * has to stay self-contained: no relative imports survive the copy.
 *
 * The run is tool-only on purpose. That is the exact shape issue #2078 reported
 * as uncontrollable: no stage is ever registered, so before the fix `quitRun`
 * saw nothing controllable and answered `no_active_stages` while the callback
 * kept running.
 *
 *   sibling-tool  completes immediately and is therefore checkpointed, which is
 *                 what makes the run resumable and what proves a settled
 *                 sibling replays from cache instead of running twice.
 *   hang-tool     never settles on its own. Its only exit is the `AbortSignal`
 *                 that `ctx.tool` now hands the callback, so every observation
 *                 below is real behavior rather than a timer.
 *
 * Execution counts and the observed abort are recorded in one JSON file under
 * `ISSUE_2078_STATE_DIR` so a driver outside this process can read them.

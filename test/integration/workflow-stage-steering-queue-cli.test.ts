/**
 * End-to-end proof for issue #2074, driven through the real Atomic CLI.
 *
 * Issue #2074 reported that the queued-message UI of a live workflow stage is
 * view-local: the queue lives on the session, but the rows that show it live in
 * the stage-chat pane that detaching destroys. Leaving the node lost them, and
 * a stage nobody was attached to gave no sign that a message was waiting on it.
 *
 * This suite starts the shipped interactive CLI in a child process
 * (`fixtures/issue-2074-interactive-host.ts`, which runs `main()` through the
 * CLI's own `internalInteractiveHarness` hook and spawns the ordinary isolated
 * engine child), points it at a scratch project holding the fixture workflow
 * and at a stand-in model endpoint that opens the stage's turn and never closes
 * it, then drives one scenario with keystrokes:
 *
 *   /workflow issue-2074-stage-steering   launch; the stage turn opens
 *   F2                                    the workflow graph overlay
 *   ↵                                     attach to the streaming stage
 *   "steer-2074-alpha" ↵                  queued as steering
 *   "followup-2074-beta" ctrl+f           queued as a follow-up
 *   ctrl+x                                detach back to the graph
 *   ↵                                     reattach to the same stage
 *
 * Nothing is mocked below the terminal: the workflows extension, the stage
 * control registry, the graph overlay, the node card and the chat host are the
 * shipped ones, and the assertions read the bytes the TUI actually wrote.
 *
 * Against the parent commit the detached node renders its ordinary `root`
 * metadata row with no badge, and reattaching renders a chat with no pending
 * rows at all — both assertions below fail there. Verified, not assumed.
 *

/**
 * Engine child that reproduces the worst ordering for request ownership.
 *
 * On its first generation it accepts a command, buries the admission frame
 * behind several reader turns of valid frames, performs a real side effect,
 * hands stdout to a descendant that keeps the pipe open, and exits. The host
 * therefore sees the child die while the frame that says "I started this work"
 * is still unparsed — and its automatic recovery begins in that same turn.
 *
 * The replacement generation just reports ready and stays alive, so the test can
 * see that recovery finished without waiting for the descendant.

/**
 * Engine death is host-local lifecycle state, not a wire event: a killed child
 * sends nothing. Two consequences are covered here against a real engine child.
 *
 *  - A child can exit between `start()` returning and the runtime attaching its
 *    listeners. A transient-only event would be lost there and the host would
 *    sit on a dead engine forever, so the terminal event is retained and
 *    replayed to a late subscriber.
 *  - Frames the dead generation left buffered must not be delivered afterwards.
 *    Component IDs restart at `remote_component_1` for every child, so a stale
 *    `engine_custom_open` would remount exactly the UI teardown just removed.
